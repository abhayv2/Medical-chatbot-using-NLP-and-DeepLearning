# Medical-chatbot-using-NLP-and-DeepLearning

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an NLP-based healthcare chatbot capable of providing preliminary medical diagnoses based on user-input symptoms. By leveraging deep learning techniques, speech recognition, and text-to-speech functionalities, the chatbot aims to enhance healthcare accessibility, improve patient engagement, and deliver timely medical advice, ultimately supporting better health outcomes and efficient medical consultations.
 
## Training Data:

The training data for the chatbot consists of a curated dataset of medical symptoms and conditions, structured in a JSON file. Each entry includes tags representing medical conditions, patterns of symptoms described by users, and corresponding responses. This dataset was preprocessed using tokenization, lemmatization, and bag-of-words techniques to convert text inputs into a structured format suitable for training a neural network. The model was trained to recognize patterns in user inputs and accurately predict the corresponding medical condition, ensuring robust and reliable performance in real-world interactions.

## Summary

Developed an NLP-based healthcare chatbot to provide preliminary medical diagnoses through text and voice interactions. The project involved data preprocessing of medical symptoms, training a neural network with Keras, and implementing speech recognition and text-to-speech for user interactions. The chatbot effectively identifies symptoms from user inputs and provides relevant medical advice, enhancing accessibility and patient engagement.
